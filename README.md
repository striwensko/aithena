# AI-thena


AI library for integrating AI in your JS projects

AI is super cool, but how do you integrate it into your projects. The purpose for this tool is that no matter what you build, you can add
AI agent to call your own project features. Imagine you create a video editing tool with bunch of features in the browser, must things
will never be discovered by the users, but how if you can ask in a chat in your tool: "Reverse my video" and it simply does it, without
you having to be an AI expert to unlock it.
